# About page

Hi there.  I'm an electronic trading specialist, experienced in the design and implementation of order management systems and electronic trading platforms. Delivered and operated high-volume, low-latency systems and implemented large-scale change projects within a complex technical and business landscape, mostly recently in response to MiFID II and Brexit.
