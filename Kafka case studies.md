    As the first pan-European exchange – spanning Belgium, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK – Euronext operates regulated securities and derivatives markets in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris, as well as a regulated securities market in Ireland and the UK. Euronext recently developed a new event-driven trading platform, Optiq®, that provides a tenfold increase in capacity and an average performance latency of as low as 15 micro-seconds for order roundtrip as well as for market data.   Underpinning the Optiq platform is a persistence layer that the Euronext development organization built using Confluent Platform. Confluent Platform provides a reliable, scalable streaming infrastructure for Optiq that supports millisecond latencies with no messages lost.
